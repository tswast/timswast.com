If an image is displaying, you can download it yourself. (Some images
display only as thumbnails outside the Library of Congress because of rights
considerations, but you have access to larger size images on site.)
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can purchase copies of various types through Library
of Congress Duplication Services.

            <strong>If a digital image is displaying:</strong>
            The qualities of the digital image
            partially depend on whether it was made from the original or an
            intermediate such as a copy negative or transparency. If the Reproduction
            Number field above includes a reproduction number that starts with
            LC-DIG..., then there is a digital image that was made directly
            from the original and is of sufficient resolution for most publication
            purposes.
        </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>If there is information listed in the Reproduction Number field above:</strong>
        You can use the reproduction number to purchase a copy from Duplication
        Services.  It will be made from the source listed in the parentheses after
        the number.

                        </strong>
                    <p></p>

<p>
Reproductions of all types are available, but Duplication Services anticipates an
8-10 week turnaround in completing orders, as all negatives must be reproduced at
their off-site, cold storage facility.

Clues that an FSA/OWI/OEM image may be affected are:<br>
<strong>Medium</strong> field says "1 negative : nitrate" OR <br>
<strong>Reproduction Number</strong> field begins with: LC-USF33-

                        with Prints and Photographs Division reference staff
                        (202-707-6394). In certain instances, duplicate
                        negatives are available for copying.

            desire a copy showing color or tint (assuming the original has any),
            you can generally purchase a quality copy of the original in color by

Please use the following steps to determine whether you need to
fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room
to view the original item(s).   In some cases, a surrogate
(substitute image) is available, often in the form of a digital
image, a copy print, or microfilm.

<ol>
<li id="step1">
    <em>Is the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will
    be visible on the left.)</em>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
            <strong>Yes, the item is digitized.</strong>
                Please use the digital image in preference to requesting
                the original. All images can be viewed at a large size
                when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress.
                In some cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available
                when you are outside the Library of Congress because the
                item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for
                rights restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an
                original item when a digital image is available.  If you
                have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with
                a reference librarian.  (Sometimes, the original is simply
                too fragile to serve. For example, glass and film photographic
                negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also
                easier to see online where they are presented as positive
                images.)

        If you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another
        surrogate, please fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs
        Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a
        few minutes. Other materials require appointments for later the
        same day or in the future.  Reference staff can advise you in
        both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served.
