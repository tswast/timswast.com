    I learned about the artist  J. M. W. Turner  last month through the  Google Art Project New Chrome Tab  extension. He is known as “the painter of light” and after looking at some of his works, I agree with that statement.
   

   
     
   

   
    Seeing the great use of light in J. M. W. Turner's Fishermen at Sea, I decided I'd try emulating it but in pixel art style. This was a lot more ambitious than my previous works, and it definitely stretched my skills. It took a month of drawing sess

My wife and I use an app called  2do  to share ToDos and shopping lists with each other. It is a beautiful app, which works for Mac, iOS, and Android. It allows us to have the same list on both her phone and mine.
 
        
 

 
To sync with each other, we have created a shared account on  Toodledo.  Remember your user name and password. Perhaps save it in a secure password saving app like  MiniKeePass .
 
        
         
            Next, go into the 2do app and click settings.

         Gray codes 
        are ways of writing numbers using only 0s and 1s. They share the property
        that as one goes from one number to the next, only one binary digit (bit)
        changes. For example, if one is represented as “001”,
        then two might be represented as “011”; only the middle bit
        changes.
         
        
        
         How are Gray codes used?

            My wife is an  archivist . As a kind of library professional, one of her peeves is when technology workers, such as myself, use  library  to mean a collection of computer code. As computer code libraries generally are not managed by a human librarian, the term seems a bit misapplied.

         An introduction to Markov chains. 
         
            A Markov chain generates a random sequence of states; it is a stochastic model which changes state over discrete time. It has a set of states, a matrix of transition probabilities, and its transitions depend only on the current state and not further history.

            Neural networks are models of the brain. Actually, there are many different kinds of

            What they have in common is that they consist of nodes
            (which model neurons) hooked together in some way. Signals then propogate through
            the network.

            The state of the system is a pair of real numbers, with the cells of the cellular

            With this mapping, I calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent for each of the 256 elementary cellular

        can help make code much simpler to write and understand. In fact, it makes some problems feel tractable, when at first they
        felt as though a complicated "brute force" technique was needed.

                Gravity v0.1 released
            </h3>
            


 

 
 I just put a new version of Gravity (beta) on  Kongregate . 
 Changes 
 I added support for multiple masses and also obstacles. Also, I fixed a bug with the physics system. The physics are much more “realistic” now. Force actually decreases with distance now! 
 Lessons Learned 
 When I added support for multiple masses, I noticed that the physics were acting “funny”. It seemed like the little boxes were being more attracted by masses on the opposite side of the map than the to ones they were near.

 Last night was the  0h Game Jam , since it was daylight savings. You can play my game at  Kongregate . 
 I decided to make a very simple physics game, where you place a mass in order to make the little “crates” hit a target. 
 Overview 
 The main idea of the game is that it is a puzzle game build around Newton’s gravity equation. Force = G * Mass1 * Mass2 / Distance^2 
 Lessons Learned 
 Most of my time was spent just getting Flash Builder to compile a template project. I sh

                Python ternary operator
            </h3>
            


 


 

 

 

 So, say you had a console Python application where you are trying to print a table of numbers as your output. You could just say 

 print label, number_1, number_2, number_3 

 and your "table" would end up looking like: 

 The first row 1.001 2.0983 10.12
Another row 11.4 3.144 35.973
Look! Yet another row 12.6 99.72 1.892
 

 Yikes, that table is a bit on the ugly side! There must be a way to get Python to create a better looking table of numbers. Good for us, there is. Batteries are incl

                Python ternary operator

 The ternary operator is one of those things that's not really necessary, but can make code quite a bit shorter when put to good use. For those of you who don't know, the ternary operator is a way to evaluate one thing if a condition is true, and a different thing if the condition is false. 

 

 C and it's relatives have had this for quite some time in the form: 

 (condition) ? (evaluate when true) : (evaluate when false);
 

 Python users, on the other hand had to resort to cryptic uses o

 I've know about list comprehensions for a while now, but I never really bothered learning how to use them. Today, I found that they really aren't that bad. In fact, if you already know how to populate a python list inside a for loop, you're 95% there already. 

 

 Say you wanted to populate a python list with 7, 7's. You might go about it by doing something like this: 

 spam = []

for x in range(7):
 spam.append(7)
 
 With list comprehensions this becomes a one-liner: 
 spam = [7 for x in
