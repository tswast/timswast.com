            My wife is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivist">archivist</a>. As a kind of library professional, one of her peeves is when technology workers, such as myself, use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">library</a> to mean a collection of computer code. As computer code libraries generally are not managed by a human librarian, the term seems a bit misapplied.

            I was surprised to read in John G. Kemeny's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684130092/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0684130092&linkCode=as2&tag=thnebetu-20">Man and the Computer</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thnebetu-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0684130092" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> the term library applied to collections of computer code. In 1972 computer code collections had not grown to <a href="https://github.com/blog/1382-three-million-users">millions of repositories</a> to which today's programmers have access, but amount of code was growing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Since Kemeny is an inventor of BASIC, which has a <a href="http://sdcc3.ucsd.edu/~ir118/MAE5W03/libraries.html">LIBRARY</a> keyword, I probably should not have been surprised by this. Mostly, it feels just a bit strange that the term library has been used for collections of reusable code just about as long as collections of reusable computer code have existed!
