<p>I just put a new version of Gravity (beta) on <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/TimSwast/gravity-beta">Kongregate</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>I added support for multiple masses and also obstacles. Also, I fixed a bug with the physics system. The physics are much more &#8220;realistic&#8221; now. Force actually decreases with distance now!</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>When I added support for multiple masses, I noticed that the physics were acting &#8220;funny&#8221;. It seemed like the little boxes were being more attracted by masses on the opposite side of the map than the to ones they were near.</p>
<p>It turns out that AS3 does not have an exponentiation operator. My late night coding resulted in the following mistake.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" title="">
// I don't think I ordered an XOR.
var dist:Number = Math.sqrt(
        (massPt.x - object.x) ^ 2 +
        (massPt.y - object.y) ^ 2);

// this is what I should have said.
var dist:Number = Math.sqrt(
        Math.pow(massPt.x - object.x, 2) +
        Math.pow(massPt.y - object.y, 2));
</pre>
<p>Also, it turns out that Flixel makes the nice memory-saving optimization of reusing graphics of the same size when you do makeGraphic(). I had to tell it to make a unique version so that I could change the background color on my buttons for add / remove.</p>
