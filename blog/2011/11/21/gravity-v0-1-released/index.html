<p class="p-summary">I just put a new version of Gravity (beta) on <a
href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/TimSwast/gravity-beta">Kongregate</a>.
I added support for multiple masses and also obstacles. Also, I fixed a
bug with the physics system. The physics are much more
&#8220;realistic&#8221; now. Force actually decreases with distance now!</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>When I added support for multiple masses, I noticed that the physics were
acting &#8220;funny&#8221;. It seemed like the little boxes were being more
attracted by masses on the opposite side of the map than the to ones they
were near.</p>

<p>It turns out that AS3 does not have an exponentiation operator. My late
night coding resulted in the following mistake.</p>

<pre><code>
<em>// I don't think I ordered an XOR.</em>
<b>var</b> dist:Number = Math.sqrt(
        (massPt.x - object.x) ^ 2 +
        (massPt.y - object.y) ^ 2);

<em>// this is what I should have said.</em>
<b>var</b> dist:Number = Math.sqrt(
        Math.pow(massPt.x - object.x, 2) +
        Math.pow(massPt.y - object.y, 2));
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it turns out that <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a> makes the
nice memory-saving optimization of reusing graphics of the same size when you
do <code>makeGraphic()</code>. I had to tell it to make a unique version so
that I could change the background color on my buttons for add / remove.</p>
