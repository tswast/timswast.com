<p>Last night was the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/10/30/0h-game-jam-not-over-yet/">0h Game Jam</a>, since it was daylight savings. You can play my game at <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/TimSwast/gravity-beta">Kongregate</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to make a very simple physics game, where you place a mass in order to make the little &#8220;crates&#8221; hit a target.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The main idea of the game is that it is a puzzle game build around Newton&#8217;s gravity equation. Force = G * Mass1 * Mass2 / Distance^2</p>
<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
<p>Most of my time was spent just getting Flash Builder to compile a template project. I should have created an ActionScript project instead of a Flex project.</p>
<p>Once I got going, I think I did the right thing by not worrying much about making it have just the right architecture. Instead, I created one FlxState and did all the game logic there. For a simple game like this, there wasn&#8217;t much need to to make things object-oriented.</p>
<h1>Plans</h1>
<p>I hope to make more levels and add obstacles to make this more of a puzzle game. Also, I&#8217;d very much like to port this to mobile devices.</p>
