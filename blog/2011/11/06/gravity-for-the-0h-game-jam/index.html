<p class="e-summary">Last night was the <a
href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/10/30/0h-game-jam-not-over-yet/">0h
Game Jam</a>, since it was daylight savings. I decided to make a very simple
physics game, where you place a mass in order to make the little
&#8220;crates&#8221; hit a target. You can play my game on <a

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The main idea of the game is that it is a puzzle game build around
Newton&#8217;s gravity equation. Force = G * Mass1 * Mass2 / Distance^2</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Most of my time was spent just getting Flash Builder to compile a template
project. I should have created an ActionScript project instead of a Flex
project.</p>

<p>Once I got going, I think I did the right thing by not worrying much about
making it have just the right architecture. Instead, I created one FlxState
and did all the game logic there. For a simple game like this, there
wasn&#8217;t much need to to make things object-oriented.</p>

<h2>Plans</h2>

<p>I hope to make more levels and add obstacles to make this more of a puzzle
game. Also, I&#8217;d very much like to port this to mobile devices.</p>
