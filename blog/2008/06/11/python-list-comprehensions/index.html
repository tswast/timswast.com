<p>I've know about list comprehensions for a while now, but I never really bothered learning how to use them. Today, I found that they really aren't that bad. In fact, if you already know how to populate a python list inside a for loop, you're 95% there&nbsp;already.</p>

<!-- Hyde::Excerpt::End -->

<p>Say you wanted to populate a python list with 7, 7's. You might go about it by doing something like&nbsp;this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>spam = []

for x in range(7):
 spam.append(7)
</code></pre>
<p>With list comprehensions this becomes a&nbsp;one-liner:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>spam = [7 for x in range(7)]
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, you take your for loop and shove it inside the list declaration. Whatever you were appending goes first. Thus, if we wanted to change our list to be 7 powers of 7, you'd&nbsp;write:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code># this gives us [1, 7, 49, ...]
spam = [7**x for x in range(7)]
</code></pre>
<p>Something as scary sounding as "list comprehension" really isn't anything more than shoving a for loop (or two) into where you declare the list. It's quite powerful, for being so&nbsp;simple. </p>
