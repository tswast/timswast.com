<div id="post-content" class="e-content">
<p class="p-summary">I've been aware list comprehensions for a while now, but
they seemed complicated, so I was afraid to use them. Today, I found that
they really aren't that bad. In fact, if you already know how to populate a
python list inside a for loop, you're 95% there&nbsp;already.</p>

<p>Say you wanted to populate a python list with 7, 7's. You might go about
it by doing something like&nbsp;this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>spam = []

<b>for</b> x <b>in</b> range(7):
   spam.append(7)
</code></pre>

<p>With list comprehensions this becomes a&nbsp;one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>spam = [7 <b>for</b> x <b>in</b> range(7)]
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, you take your for loop and shove it inside the list
declaration. Whatever you were appending goes first. Thus, if we wanted to
change our list to be 7 powers of 7, you'd&nbsp;write:</p>

<pre><code># this gives us [1, 7, 49, ...]
spam = [7 <b>**</b> x <b>for</b> x <b>in</b> range(7)]
</code></pre>

<p>Something as scary sounding as "list comprehension" really isn't anything
more than shoving a for loop (or two) into where you declare the list. It's
quite powerful, for being so&nbsp;simple.</p>
