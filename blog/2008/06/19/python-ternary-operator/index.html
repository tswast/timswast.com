<p class="p-summary">The ternary operator isn't necessary (Python didn't have
one for years), but it can make code clearer when put to good use. The
ternary operator consists of three parts: a condition, an expression to
evaluate if the condition is true, and another expression to evaluate if the
condition is false.</p>

<p>C and its relatives have a ternary operator that looks like the
following:</p>

<pre><code>(condition) ? (evaluate when true) : (evaluate when false);
</code></pre>

<p>Python users could use a normal if statement for this. But some
programmers, who desired all the logic appear in single statement, resorted
to cryptic uses of the 'and' and 'or' operators.

<pre><code>(evaluate_this_first) <b>and</b> (return_this_if_the_left_was_true)
(return_if_it_evaluates_as_true) <b>or</b> (return_if_left_evaluated_as_false)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/">PEP 308</a> adds a
true ternary operator to Python:

<pre><code>(evaluate when true) <b>if</b> (condition) <b>else</b> (evaluate when false)
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion, the Python ternary operator avoids some of the problems
with C-style ternary operators. Since the Python code reads more like an
English sentence, it's easier to remember which statement is evaluated when
the condition is true and which is evaluated when the condition is false.
