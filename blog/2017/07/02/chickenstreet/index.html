<p class="e-summary">I learned about the <a
href="http://iampixeltier.com/chickenstreet/">pixel artist Sascha Naderer's
#Chickenstreet project</a> last year. Immediately I knew I wanted to make an
entry.</p>

<p>Since the idea behind the Chickenstreet project is that we are filling out
the basement floors to <a href="http://www.mrwong.de/myhouse/">Mr. Wong's
Soup'Partments</a>, I wanted my art to show what I would most want in a dream
basement: a bowling alley and
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousPipeOrgan">pipe
organ</a>.

<p>The trouble with my dream was I had never drawn isometric pixel art before.
I practiced with some smaller scenes over the course of 9 months to improve my
skills.

<p>After a few months of practice, I started working on scenes that I knew I
wanted to include in the final #Chickenstreet submission.

<p>After completing both of these, it took me about a month to assemble into the
final piece. Total time wasn't nearly as much, since I'm working full time and
only worked on this on average 15 minutes a day. Still, this was the largest
pixel art project I have ever done. I'm super happy with the result, but know
that I have a lot still to learn in making pixel art and isometric art.
