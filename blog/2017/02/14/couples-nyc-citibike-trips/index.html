<p class="e-summary">For this Valentine’s Day themed data doodle, let’s use
BigQuery and the <a
href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/nyc-citi-bike">New York
City public dataset on Citibike trips</a> and to find a romantic spot to bike
to with a significant other.</p>

<p>The number 1 spot for groups of people to bike to together is the
   <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/5th+Ave+%26+E+88th+St,+New+York,+NY+10128/@40.7799533,-73.9702846,15.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258a29e220ba3:0x4f94dc983b291f7c!8m2!3d40.7828435!4d-73.9594741">
    5 Ave &amp; E 88 St Citibike station</a>,
right by Central Park, with 30% of trips completed by groups. Also in top
spots were the other stations around Central Park:

    Cadman Plaza E &amp; Tillary St
   </a>
   in Brooklyn, with 26% of trips completed by groups. Third place goes to
   <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Citi+Bike+-+Brooklyn+Bridge+Park+-+Pier+2/@40.6963866,-73.9987862,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1zQnJvb2tseW4gQnJpZGdlIFBhcmvigIrigJTigIpQaWVyIDIgY2l0aWJpa2U!3m4!1s0x0:0xa5e291597d74e6d!8m2!3d40.6987794!4d-73.9971203">
    Brooklyn Bridge Park — Pier 2</a>, with 22% of trips completed by groups.



<p>Where does the data say you shouldn’t you take your significant other?
Only 1% of trips completed at the <a
href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/valet">Penn Station Valet station</a> were
by groups of cyclists.

<p>Code for the <a
href="https://gist.github.com/tswast/6f64b09f5cd12fcb890bf30db06c6133#file-nyc-citibike-groups-destinations-sql">
query to find where couples are going on the NYC Citibikes</a>:

<pre><code>#standardSql
SELECT
  group_trips / (single_trips + group_trips) AS percent_groups,
  single_trips + group_trips AS total_trips,
  q.end_station_id AS end_station_id,
  stations.name AS name,
  stations.latitude AS latitude,
  stations.longitude AS longitude
FROM (
  SELECT
    COUNTIF(group_size = 1) AS single_trips,
    COUNTIF(group_size != 1) AS group_trips,
    end_station_id
  FROM (
    SELECT
      ROUND(UNIX_SECONDS(starttime) / 120) AS start,
      -- round to nearest 2 minutes
      ROUND(UNIX_SECONDS(stoptime) / 120) AS stop,
      -- round to nearest 2 minutes
      start_station_id,
      end_station_id,
      COUNT(*) AS group_size
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
    GROUP BY
      start,
      stop,
      start_station_id,
      end_station_id )
  GROUP BY
    end_station_id ) q
LEFT JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_stations` AS stations
ON
  q.end_station_id = stations.station_id
ORDER BY
percent_groups DESC
</code></pre>

<p>Breaking this query down, I group Citibike trips together into ones that start
and end at about the same time. If the grouped-together trip had more than one
person in it, then it’s counted as a group trip. This could be a couple or a
group of friends riding together. Possibly it could be people that happened
to check out a bike at the same time and go to the same place at the same
rate, but I’m considering that a rare occurrence. Then, I find which stations
have the highest percentage of trips from groups versus single-rider
trips.

<p>If you want to run the analysis yourself, I’ve shared the query
