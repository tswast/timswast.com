    <h1>How many <abbr title="3 by 3">3x3</abbr> images with 3 colors are there?</h1>
  </a>
  <span class="post-date">Tuesday, November 21, 2017</span>
</div>

<p>There are <abbr title="3 to the ninth power">3⁹</abbr>, or <abbr
title="nineteen thousand, six hundred eighty-three">19,683</abbr>, <abbr
title="3 by 3">3x3</abbr> images with 3 colors. There are 9 pixels, each with
3 possible values. Since pixels arranged in a different order are a different
image, we multiply 3 for each pixel.

<h2>What if the middle pixel is missing or always the same color?</h2>

<p>I'm working on a project where I don't care about the center pixel because
it will always be the same color. How many of these donut-shaped images are
there?

<p>There is only 1 possibility for the center pixel. There are
still 3 possible colors for the remaining 8 pixels, so there are <abbr
title="3 to the eighth power">3⁸</abbr>, or <abbr title="six thousand, five
hundred sixty-one">6,561</abbr>, <abbr title="3 by 3">3x3</abbr> donut-shaped
images with 3 colors.

<h2>What if we consider a rotated image to be the same image?</h2>

<p>If rotated images are considered the same, we know there are up to 4
possible rotations. We might be tempted to divide 6,561 by 4, but there are
some images that are rotationally symmetric. This means dividing by 4 will
give us too few images.

<p>To get the precise count, I've written this Python script:

<p>1,665.

<h2>What if we consider a reflected or rotated image to be the same image?</h2>
