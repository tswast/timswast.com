                Tim Swast - Chickenstreet Entry
            </h3>
            

 I learned about the  pixel
artist Sascha Naderer's #Chickenstreet project  last year. Immediately I knew
I wanted to make an entry.

 
   
   My entry to  #Chickenstreet . 
 

 Since the idea behind the Chickenstreet project is that we are filling out
the basement floors to  Mr. Wong's
Soup'Partments , I wanted my art to show what I would most want in a dream
basement: a bowling alley and

organ .

 The trouble with my dream was I had never drawn isometric pixel art before.

 In the  article introducing
the pixel art bot village , we saw art that was completely randomly
generated. The pixel art bot was blindly drawing. Now the bot can see, and it‚Äôs
only 34.5% happy with what it has produced.

 
   
   An artwork generated by drawing each pixel according to which

 What does it mean to see? 

 Sight is
more than input. Imagine a window: light passes through it, but a window can
hardly be said to see. Sight requires some level

 I‚Äôve had a goal since at least January 2015 to create more artwork with computers. I want
artistic software not as a tool, but as a partner. I finally decided to act on this goal by
creating a pixel art bot.

 
   
   The interface used by the pixel art bot I built, along with its
  first artwork. 
 

 I want a bot who helps me make the things I want to make but also has independent interests.
It should learn over time, adapting to its experiences and interests.

 I had a late entry to the  0-hour game jam 
this year.  I didn't feel like getting up at 1AM, but I still wanted to use my
"extra" hour to make a game this year.  I built a game of
 Go Fish! .  Enjoy!

 It doesn't use any images, only the  Unicode
  characters for playing cards  and a few emoji.  It ended up taking me
maybe 4 or 5 hours instead of 0 or 1 (which surprised me a bit, since it's
such a simple game).  Hopefully the next card game I make will be a bit
easier

 I've been thinking a lot about cooperation lately. I've recently become
a maintainer of  Frozen-Flask ,
and an open-source web-app I'm working on called
 Who Goes First  is getting close to
the 1.0 milestone. I want to make sure the projects that are under my care
stay healthy.

 Why do I contribute to open source? 

 I think I want 3 things from an open-source project. I want someone to
use what I make. I want the project to possibly last longer than me, so
I want contributors who will collaborate with

 My interest in generative art and art bots brought my attention to works by
 Anders Hoff . I love that he explains how
he made many of his works, including
 linetrace .
It was computer-generated, but inspired by the
 hand-drawn
works by John Franzen .

 I have found it quite relaxing to draw something similar by hand during
breaks at work. It's quite the stress-reducer.

 
   
   
 

 It's funny how much my steadiness varies, even within a single day. I
think I get quite a bit more jittery when stressed.

 I've had quite a few train rides this past month. One thing I really love about
trains is that there isn't as much stop and go. This makes it much easier to
draw while I travel.

 
   
   
 

 I'm fascinated by old steam trains. I especially enjoyed looking at the
 Russian steam locomotive U-127 .
It is the trainiest of all the trains that looked at. The engine is distinct, and
its exaggerated features made the U-127 perfect for a pixel art rendition.

 It was a lot of fun to draw. I also really enjoyed

        I had been itching to draw some more pixel art, so I used this photo as

            jam  this early morning time change. It was a lot of fun.  The
        zero hour game jam is a goofy idea that you can use the "extra" hour we
        get at 2 AM the night of the fall daylight savings switch to make a
        game. As you can imagine, it generates a lot of goofy little games.
        It's been super fun the years I've participated.

      I like using the smaller canvas because it is a challenge to find a shape that works, but also easier because there is no temptation to try to add more detail. Also, I'm learning that limiting the amount of motion can make for a better animation.

    I have been drawing a few pixel art walking animations, lately. This has been a lot of fun. Animation adds some life to the artwork and can add some goofy fun to drawing.
   

   

   
    One of the lessons I've learned doing this is that subtle changes work better than detailed changes, especially at low resolutions. I started this baby dinosaur with the version on the left. It has spots that seem to jump around. I tried to get too detailed and it ended up distracting.

   After admiring this, I decided to recreate it. 

   

   One reason I really enjoy pixel art is that it allows you to do a lot with very few materials. Here the MTA subway car uses only 16 red LED lights, but does so in a way that is obvi

         Gray codes 
        are ways of writing numbers using only 0s and 1s. They share the property
        that as one goes from one number to the next, only one binary digit (bit)
        changes. For example, if one is represented as ‚Äú001‚Äù,
        then two might be represented as ‚Äú011‚Äù; only the middle bit
        changes.

         An introduction to Markov chains. 
         
            A Markov chain generates a random sequence of states; it is a stochastic model which changes state over discrete time. It has a set of states, a matrix of transition probabilities, and its transitions depend only on the current state and not further history.

            neural network models. ( Wallis )
            What they have in common is that they consist of nodes
            (which model neurons) hooked together in some way. Signals then propogate through

            The state of the system is a pair of real numbers, with the cells of the cellular
            automata state corresponding to binary digits of the real numbers.
            With this mapping, I calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent for each of the 256 elementary cellular

        felt as though a complicated "brute force" technique was needed.

 I just put a new version of Gravity (beta) on  Kongregate . 
 Changes 
 I added support for multiple masses and also obstacles. Also, I fixed a bug with the physics system. The physics are much more ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù now. Force actually decreases with distance now! 
 Lessons Learned 
 When I added support for multiple masses, I noticed that the physics were acting ‚Äúfunny‚Äù. It seemed like the little boxes were being more attracted by masses on the opposite side of the map than the to ones they were near.

 and your "table" would end up looking¬†like: 

 The first row 1.001 2.0983 10.12
Another row 11.4 3.144 35.973
Look! Yet another row 12.6 99.72 1.892
 

 Yikes, that table is a bit on the ugly side! There must be a way to get Python to create a better looking table of numbers. Good for us, there is. Batteries are incl

 The ternary operator is one of those things that's not really necessary, but can make code quite a bit shorter when put to good use. For those of you who don't know, the ternary operator is a way to evaluate one thing if a condition is true, and a different thing if the condition is¬†false. 

 

 C and it's relatives have had this for quite some time in the¬†form: 

 (condition) ? (evaluate when true) : (evaluate when false);
 

 Python users, on the other hand had to resort to cryptic uses o

 I've know about list comprehensions for a while now, but I never really bothered learning how to use them. Today, I found that they really aren't that bad. In fact, if you already know how to populate a python list inside a for loop, you're 95% there¬†already. 

 

 Say you wanted to populate a python list with 7, 7's. You might go about it by doing something like¬†this: 

 spam = []

for x in range(7):
 spam.append(7)
 
 With list comprehensions this becomes a¬†one-liner: 
 spam = [7 for x in
