<p>IPS made is a huge step forward compared to SysV packaging. One can still
create and use SysV packages in Solaris 11, but why would you? IPS provides
easy package distribution, upgrades, dependency resolution, and it's still <a
    href="http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+pkg/">open</a> <a
    href="http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/pkg/gate/">source</a>!
</p>

<p>
Conceptually, IPS is a bit different from System V packages. An IPS package is
not just a collection of scripts and files. Instead, IPS works by specifying
"actions" (e.g. create directory, copy file, etc.). Similar to other packaging
systems, it also includes metadata in a manifest file (e.g. pkg dependencies,
descriptions).
</p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
These instructions will go through the steps necessary to setup IPS servers
needed to create and host multiple architecture (fat) IPS packages. Basically,
we will create three repositories and three IPS servers to host them. To keep
things as simple as possible, I'll assume they will all be hosted from the
same physical machine (and the same zone).
</p>

<p>
For projects that need to be compiled for SPARC and x86 (IPS calls them the
sparc and i386 variants, respectively), ideally one would create a
"universal" package that can be installed to sparc or x86 machines. The way
this is done in Solaris is to create a separate package for each "variant" and
then to "merge" them into one package. This means three IPS servers are
required, one for each architecture, and one for the merged package.
</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>

The last paragraph had quite a few terms in it that have special meaning in
IPS-speak. Learning the following terms will help quite a bit in understanding
what needs to be done to create and host IPS packages.

<dl>
    <dt>package</dt>
    <dd>This is the "what" in IPS. What is it you would like to install?</dd>
    <dt>publisher</dt>
    <dd>This is the "who" in IPS. Who is it that is providing this package?</dd>
    <dt>variant</dt>
    <dd>This is more specifically, what kind of package are you installing?
    Examples include sparc/i386 and debug/non-debug.</dd>
    <dt>repository</dt>
    <dd>This is a collection of packages. It can include packages from
    multiple publishers, for example, if one wanted to mirror Oracle packages
    in addition to internally-created packages.</dd>
    <dt>server</dt>
    <dd>This is the software responsible for <em>hosting</em> a repository.</dd>
    <dt>merge</dt>
    <dd>This means combining two IPS package variants into one package.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Note that the publisher name is associated with a package, not the particular
server. A server does have a default publisher, though. When you query for
packages and send new packages to the server, the default publisher is used
unless otherwise specified.

<h2>Create repositories</h2>

<p>
In order to create a package which supports multiple architectures, we need
three repositories. One for sparc variants, one for i386 variants, and one for
the merged packages. This does not mean we need three machines, or even three
zones. We will simply run multiple IPS servers, each on a different port.

<p>
To keep the instructions simple, we are going to use the same default
publisher name for all three servers we create.  Remember, the publisher is
supposed to identify "who" publishes a package, not "where" they are
published. It makes sense that each repository should have the same default
publisher name. For this example we will use "mycompany" as the publisher.

<h2>Setup local ZFS filesystems</h2>

The first thing we will do is create ZFS filesystems for each repository.

<pre>
  zfs create rpool/export/ips
  zfs create rpool/export/ips/default
  zfs create rpool/export/ips/sparc
  zfs create rpool/export/ips/x86
  zfs set mountpoint=/export/ips rpool/export/ips
</pre>

Next, we create a skeleton for each IPS repository.

<pre>
  pkgrepo create /export/ips/default
  pkgrepo create /export/ips/sparc
  pkgrepo create /export/ips/x86
</pre>

Finally, we set the publisher name. As I said before, this is the "who"
publishes the package, not "where" it is published. I use "mycompany" in this
example, since I'm creating a package for my company's internal use.

<pre>
  pkgrepo set -s /export/ips/default publisher/prefix=mycompany
  pkgrepo set -s /export/ips/sparc publisher/prefix=mycompany
  pkgrepo set -s /export/ips/x86 publisher/prefix=mycompany
</pre>


<h2>Setup SMF-based IPS servers</h2>

For this example, we create multiple instances of the SMF-based pkg server.
There are other options, file-system based sharing for example, but it seems
that creating multiple server instances is the best-supported method of
hosting.

<h2>Setup IPS default (multi-architecture) server</h2>

The first thing we will do is setup the default server on the standard http port (80).

<pre>
  svccfg -s application/pkg/server setprop pkg/port=80
</pre>

Next, tell it which repository to use.

<pre>
  svccfg -s application/pkg/server setprop pkg/inst_root=/export/ips/default
</pre>

Since we want to be able to publish to this repository, change the readonly property to false.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server setprop pkg/readonly=false
</pre>

Refresh the pkg/server SMF service, to make sure the configuration changes get loaded.

<pre>
  svcadm refresh application/pkg/server
</pre>

Start the repository service.

<pre>
  svcadm enable application/pkg/server
</pre>

The IPS server can now be reached at http://myipsserver Check that it is running with the svcs command.

<pre>
  % svcs pkg/server
  STATE          STIME    FMRI
  online         May_08   svc:/application/pkg/server:default
</pre>


<h2>Setup IPS sparc server</h2>

We need to add a new instance to SMF. Since we're already using the default
instance, we give it the name "sparc". We then need to do some basic
configuration.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server add sparc
  svccfg -s pkg/server:sparc addpg pkg application
  svccfg -s pkg/server:sparc addpg general framework
  svccfg -s pkg/server:sparc setprop general/complete=astring:\"\"
  svccfg -s pkg/server:sparc setprop general/enabled=boolean: true
</pre>

Next, we set the port number. Since 80 is used already, we can use 8000.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server:sparc setprop pkg/port=8000
</pre>

Set the root repository directory.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server:sparc setprop pkg/inst_root=/export/ips/sparc
</pre>

Change the readonly property to false.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server:sparc setprop pkg/readonly=false
</pre>

Refresh to get configuration changes.

<pre>
  svcadm disable pkg/server:sparc
  svcadm refresh pkg/server:sparc
</pre>

Start the server.

<pre>
  svcadm enable pkg/server:sparc
</pre>

The IPS server can now be reached at http://myipsserver:8000


<h2>Setup IPS x86 server</h2>

Now we'll add the final server instance to SMF. As before, we're already using
the default instance, so we give this one a name. Finally, we add basic
configuration.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server add x86
  svccfg -s pkg/server:x86 addpg pkg application
  svccfg -s pkg/server:x86 addpg general framework
  svccfg -s pkg/server:x86 setprop general/complete=astring:\"\"
  svccfg -s pkg/server:x86 setprop general/enabled=boolean: true
</pre>

Next, we set the port number. Since 80 and 8000 are already use, we can use 8001.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server:x86 setprop pkg/port=8001
</pre>

Set the root repository directory.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server:x86 setprop pkg/inst_root=/export/ips/x86
</pre>

Change the readonly property to false.

<pre>
  svccfg -s pkg/server:x86 setprop pkg/readonly=false
</pre>

Refresh to get configuration changes.

<pre>
  svcadm disable pkg/server:x86
  svcadm refresh pkg/server:x86
</pre>

Start the server.

<pre>
  svcadm enable pkg/server:x86
</pre>

The IPS server can now be reached at http://myipsserver:8001


<h2>Build and publish the package</h2>

Now that we have all the IPS servers setup, we can build and publish our
package. In <a href="../packaging-matplotlib-for-multi-arch/">part 3</a>, we
will create a multi-architecture (fat) IPS package for matplotlib, which we
compiled in <a href="../compiling-matplotlib-with-solaris-studio/">part 1</a>.
