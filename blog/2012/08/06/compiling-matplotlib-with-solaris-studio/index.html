<p class="p-summary">This is part 1 of a three-part series on building and
packaging matplotlib as a multi-architecture, Solaris IPS package. At the end
of this series, you should be able to install matplotlib as easily as any
other Solaris 11 package, on both SPARC and x86 machines.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> is a library for creating
plots from Python.

<p>Matplotlib has become a frequently used tool in my toolbox. I love how
simple it is to go from a couple numpy arrays to many different types of
plots.

<h2>Setup build environment</h2>

<p>For this build we will be using <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/overview/index.html">Solaris
Studio</a>. Add Solaris Studio to your path. My Solaris Studio was installed
at <code>/opt/SUNWspro</code>, so I ran:

<pre>export PATH="/opt/SUNWspro/bin:${PATH}"
</pre>

<p>Solaris 11 comes with Python 2.6 and numpy libraries built-in. Using these
worked just fine for me.

<p>If not done before, install system headers, for compilation. If these are
not present, you will get an error like: <code>"/usr/include/python2.6/Python.h",
line 22: Error: #error "Something's broken. UCHAR_MAX should be defined in
limits.h.".</code>

<pre>sudo pkg install system/header</pre>

<p>We need to trick Python distutils into using C++ instead of C. The easiest
way I found to do this was to set the C compiler environment variable to the
Solaris Studio C++ compiler.

<pre>export CC=CC
</pre>

<h2>Apply changes to matplotlib 1.1.0</h2>

<p>I used the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.1.0/matplotlib-1.1.0.tar.gz/download">source
distribution of matplotlib 1.1.0</a> for these instructions. Different
changes may be needed for other versions.

<p>There are only a few changes needed to get matplotlib to compile with
Solaris Studio. Basically, I needed to set the standard libraries to
<code>['Crun', 'Cstd']</code>. I then had to change every library listed in
the build file to link with the standard libraries (add the std_libs
extension to all <code>build_*</code> functions in compile).

<h2>Compile!</h2>

<p>If this is the only machine on which you need matplotlib, you can go ahead
an run the standard Python build commands:

<pre>python setup.py build
python setup.py install
</pre>

<p>To build a multiple architecture matplotlib IPS package, the easiest thing
to do is to build on a SPARC machine and an x86 machine. This means following
these instructions twice, once on each machine.

<p>In order to create a package of matplotlib for use on other machines, one
should install to a "prototype" installation folder. Since Python is
installed in <code>/usr</code> on S11, we create a faux "usr" directory in
our prototype installation folder. Replace <code>[sparc|i386]</code> with
whichever architecture you are currently building.

<pre>mkdir ../install_[sparc|i386]
mkdir ../install_[sparc|i386]/usr
</pre>

<p>
Next, use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#alternate-installation-unix-the-prefix-scheme">distutils --prefix option</a> to install into your prototype installation folder.

<pre>
  python setup.py install --prefix ../install_[sparc|x86]/usr
</pre>
</p>

<p>
That's it! Now all we need to do is package it. :-)
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Yong Sun for his very helpful instructions on <a href="http://yongsun.me/2008/11/build-matplotlib-0-98-3-on-solaris-with-sunstudio-12/">building version 0.98.3</a>.
</p>

<p>
The next step after compiling is finding a way to distribute it. In <a href="../setting-up-ips-for-multi-arch-packages/">part 2</a>, I walk you through setting up the IPS servers you'll need to publish matplotlib for SPARC and x86.
