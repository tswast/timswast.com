<p>
This is part 1 of a three-part series on building and packaging matplotlib as a multi-architecture, Solaris IPS package.

</ol>

<p>
At the end of this series, you should be able to install matplotlib as easily as any other Solaris 11 package, on both SPARC and x86 machines.
<pre>
  pkg install library/python-2/python-matplotlib-26
</pre>
</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a> is a library for creating plots from Python.

<p>
Matplotlib has become a frequently used tool in my toolbox. I love how simple it is to go from a couple numpy arrays to many different types of plots.
</p>



<h1>Setup build environment</h1>

<p>
For this build we will be using <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/overview/index.html">Solaris Studio</a>. Add Solaris Studio to your path. My Solaris Studio was installed at /opt/SUNWspro, so I ran:
<pre>
  export PATH="/opt/SUNWspro/bin:${PATH}"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Solaris 11 comes with Python 2.6 and numpy libraries built-in. Using these worked just fine for me.
</p>

<p>
If not done before, install system headers, for compilation. If these are not present, you will get an error like: "/usr/include/python2.6/Python.h", line 22: Error: #error "Something's broken.  UCHAR_MAX should be defined in limits.h.".

<pre>
  sudo pkg install system/header
</pre>
</p>

<p>
We need to trick Python distutils into using C++ instead of C. The easiest way I found to do this was to set the C compiler environment variable to the Solaris Studio C++ compiler.

<pre>
  export CC=CC
</pre>
</p>



<h1>Apply changes to matplotlib 1.1.0</h1>

<p>
I used the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.1.0/matplotlib-1.1.0.tar.gz/download">source distribution of matplotlib 1.1.0</a> for these instructions. Different changes may be needed for other versions.
</p>

<p>
There are only a few changes needed to get matplotlib to compile with Solaris Studio. Basically, I needed to set the standard libraries to ['Crun', 'Cstd']. I then had to change every library listed in the build file to link with the standard libraries (add the std_libs extension to all build_* functions in compile).

<pre>

<h1>Compile!</h1>

<p>
If this is the only machine on which you need matplotlib, you can go ahead an run the standard

<pre>
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To build a multiple architecture matplotlib IPS package, the easiest thing to do is to build on a SPARC machine and an x86 machine. This means following these instructions twice, once on each machine.
</p>

<p>
In order to create a package of matplotlib for use on other machines, one
should install to a "prototype" installation folder. Since Python is
installed in /usr on S11, we create a faux "usr" directory in our prototype
installation folder. Replace [sparc|i386] with whichever architecture you are
currently building.

<pre>
  mkdir ../install_[sparc|i386]
  mkdir ../install_[sparc|i386]/usr
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Next, use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#alternate-installation-unix-the-prefix-scheme">distutils --prefix option</a> to install into your prototype installation folder.

<pre>
  python setup.py install --prefix ../install_[sparc|x86]/usr
</pre>
</p>

<p>
That's it! Now all we need to do is package it. :-)
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Yong Sun for his very helpful instructions on <a href="http://yongsun.me/2008/11/build-matplotlib-0-98-3-on-solaris-with-sunstudio-12/">building version 0.98.3</a>.
</p>

<p>
The next step after compiling is finding a way to distribute it. In <a href="../setting-up-ips-for-multi-arch-packages/">part 2</a>, I walk you through setting up the IPS servers you'll need to publish matplotlib for SPARC and x86.
