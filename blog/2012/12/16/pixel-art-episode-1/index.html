<p class="e-summary">Lately, I've been playing with <a
href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/pixeld">Disney PIXEL'D</a>
on my iPad, and I've been enjoying using it a lot. While I've been able to
make pixel art with other programs on my computer, this is by far the easiest
program I've used to make pixel art animations.</p>

<p>
So far I've been using the free version, and it has worked great. The stamp
features are geared more towards kids, but this is a very well done
application for adults to use, too. The $4.99 pro-pack gets you 7 layers
instead of 3, camera import, additional animation frames, and the ability to
remove the pixel'd logo from exporting large animations.

<p>
My only complaint is that I couldn't figure out how to remove animation
frames once they are added. As a result, the first animation I made turned
from a walking cowboy into a dancing cowboy.

<p>
I think it turned out well, though.

<p>
Mostly, I have kept to a 16x16 pixel canvas. It limits the amount of detail I
can add, but it's a very different experience creating art. For example, even
though it is far from anatomically correct, the cowboy's head and hat are 8
pixels high, exactly half of the whole canvas.

<p>
We humans place such an emphasis on faces, though, this cowboy with a head as
large as his body hardly looks strange to us. In order to create a character
at 16x16 pixels, I find that one needs to stretch proportions a bit. Faces
are much too important to place at <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_proportions#Basics_of_human_proportions">1/7th
to 1/8th of the whole</a>, since that would give us only 2 or 3 pixels of
height to work with.

<p>
Using a this rule-of-thumb to use half the canvas, I created a portrait of a
cat. The head-to-body proportions are cartoonish, but it allows me to create
a cat <em>character</em>.

<p>
I drew this bus while on the bus. Breaking from my previous drawings, it uses
a canvas of size 32x16.

<p>
This &ldquo;snail&rdquo; started life as something similar to the USB
trident-style symbol <img src="usb.svg" alt="USB trident logo"
style="display: inline; height: 1em; width: 1.6em;" />. I find it interesting
how little animation it takes to turn a symbol to a strange creature.
