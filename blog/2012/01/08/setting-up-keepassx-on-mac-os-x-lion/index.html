<p class="p-summary">This guide walks through the steps I followed to build
<a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> on my Mac. I found I needed
to install many prerequisites in order for it to build.</p>

<h2>Install GnuPG libraries</h2>

<p>First download and install libgpg-error.<br />
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/download/#libgpg-error">http://www.gnupg.org/download/#libgpg-error</a></p>

<p>Build and install. (Should go to <code>/usr/local/*</code>.)</p>

<pre>./configure
make
sudo make install</pre>

<p>Then, download and install libgcrypt.<br />
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/download/#libgcrypt">http://www.gnupg.org/download/#libgcrypt</a></p>

<p>Build and install.</p>

<pre>./configure
make
sudo make install</pre>

<h2>Install Qt4</h2>

<p>Download and install Qt4 from <a
href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads">http://qt.nokia.com/downloads</a>.</p>

<p>Note that in order for me to get the installer to work, I had to install
to a subdirectory of my home directory, not in a global location. I think
this is because the post-install scripts don&#8217;t ask for the proper
permissions. They&#8217;ll fail if you don&#8217;t have write permissions to
a directory.</p>

<p>After it was installed, I had to add the Qt utilities to my
<code>~/.bash_profile</code>. For me, these were located in
<code>~/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc/bin</code>.</p>

<h2>Build KeePassX</h2>

<p>In order to build KeePassX, I had to add a &#8220;bundle
destination&#8221; to <code>src/CMakeLists.txt</code>.</p>

<pre>$ diff src/CMakeLists.txt.old src/CMakeLists.txt
  add_executable( ${PROGNAME} WIN32 MACOSX_BUNDLE main.cpp )
  target_link_libraries( ${PROGNAME} keepassx_core \
    ${QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY} ${QT_QTGUI_LIBRARY} \
    ${GCRYPT_LIBRARIES} ${ZLIB_LIBRARIES} )
- install(TARGETS ${PROGNAME} DESTINATION ${BIN_INSTALL_DIR})
+ install(TARGETS ${PROGNAME}
+     BUNDLE DESTINATION .
+     RUNTIME DESTINATION ${BIN_INSTALL_DIR} COMPONENT Runtime)
</pre>

<p>Then, as the INSTALL file says, run</p>
<pre>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>For this project, I thought I had to tell configure to use the 32-bit
architecture, since it couldn&#8217;t find symbols when I tried the default
64-bit. (It turns out that I just hadn&#8217;t installed the libraries in the
correct order.)</p>

<p>For future reference, if you need to force a 32-bit architecture, do
this.</p>

<pre>./configure CC="gcc -arch i386" CXX="g++ -arch i386"
make
sudo make install</pre>
