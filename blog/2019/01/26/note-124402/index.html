<title>"The entire transaction volume of the Bitcoin network could be handled by a Raspberry Pi in a shoebox."

http://adamierymenko.com/decentralization.html

This whole article is fascinating. It does feel like the CAP theorem is quite relevant here. Bitcoin is all about shared global state.

I like Scuttlebutt (where I originally made this post) because it doesn't require centralization to work, but it can work better with just a little bit of centralization (through "pubs"). Bitcoin still makes me sick just thinking about all the wasted energy.</title>
