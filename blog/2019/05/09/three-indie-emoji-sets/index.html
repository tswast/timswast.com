<p class="p-summary">Emoji are practical art pieces. We share these little
images multiple times a day. In this post, I share a few emoji sets that
indie designers have published under open licences. They bring me joy where I
am able to use them.


<h2>Mutant Standard</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" />

<p>Mutant Standard is the epitome of an indie emoji set. <a
href="https://noct.zone/">Dzuk</a> created a full set of emoji, with
additions to the standard to make it more inclusive. It's specifically
licensed under a non-commercial license to separate Mutant Standard from
corporate interests.

<h2>Blobmoji</h2>

<p><img alt="gumdrop-shaped 'blob' smileys" src="images/image4.png" />

<p>I was <a
href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/rip-blobs-google-redesigns-emojis/">sad to
see the beloved blobs go</a>, but with the blobmoji project, you can have
them back! Constantin, the designer, has even created blob versions of new
emoji, keeping up with the latest Unicode standards.

<p>This project makes me smile. I love that these cute blobs have been
granted a new life by this indie project.

<h2>Bananamoji - Pixel Art Emoji</h2>

<p><img class="pixel-art" alt="pixel art emoji that look like foxes" src="images/image3.png" />

<p>I’ve been making pixel art emoji sets for my friends and family since 2017,
though I've increased my rate of production in 2019. I want to make gifts that
my friends can use every day in conversation. In recent months, I’ve made it a
personal goal to draw a different emoji each day, with a particular friend in
mind for each set.

<h2>How do I use indie emoji?</h2>

<p>It's pretty difficult to <a
href="https://github.com/C1710/blobmoji/wiki/Installation-Usage"> use indie
emoji as your phone's emoji set</a>. It's possible on Android, but I haven't
found a way to do it without rooting my phone, so I haven't tried. Still,
these emoji can be used in apps that support custom emoji, like Discord,
Mastodon, and Slack.

<p>I've found that the emoji PNG images work well as stickers in <a
href="https://pic-collage.com/">Pic Collage</a>. Download an image, such as
<a href="https://stickers.bananajuice.tech/en/sticker/fox_cook/">the foxy
chef emoji</a>, to your phone and add it to your collage as a "photo", Pic
Collage respects the transparency layer, so the emoji looks like a sticker.

<h2>Honorable Mention - Twemoji</h2>

<p>I give an honorable mention to Twemoji. It's not "indie", but Twitter
makes its full set of emoji available under a Creative Commons license. It's
a great resource for designers and developers.

<h2>What is the future of indie emoji?</h2>

<p>There are thousands of emoji now. That's an overwhelming number for any
single designer to make. Personally, I find it inspiring. I love a project
that I can slowly make progress on. I'm not in a rush to finish the whole
set, and I'm enjoying the journey so far.

<p>It's my hope that it will get easier to use a customized emoji set.
There's lots of room in the emoji standard for expressing individual
personality, even if it's just visible on your own device. In the meantime,
enjoy these indie emoji in apps that allow custom emoji and as stickers for
your photos.
