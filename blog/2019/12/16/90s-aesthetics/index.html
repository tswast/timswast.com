<h1 class="p-name">90s Aesthetics in Modern Tech</h1>
<h2>Approaching a blank canvas, 16x16 pixels at a time</h2>

<div class="e-content">
<p>This post was <a href="https://medium.com/offline-camp/90s-aesthetics-in-modern-tech-4084489ba119">originally published on the Offline Camp Medium publication</a>.

<p>I have the following goals for my personal projects:

<ul>
<li>I want the end-product to be approachable.</li>
<li>I want it to feel effortless for me to make progress on the project.</li>
<li>I want the project to remain useful for a long time.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p-summary">In my lightning talk at Offline Camp Oregon 2019, I
share how my personal project goals led me towards 1990s aesthetics.

<p>These design principles have guided several of my recent projects. For
example, my <a href="https://stickers.bananajuice.tech/" rel="noopener
nofollow" target="_blank">pixel art emoji stickers</a> are clearly inspired
by the 90s aesthetic.

<p>Likewise, I craft the HTML for <a href="https://www.timswast.com/"
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">my personal website</a> by hand,
similar to what folks did in the early web.

<p>In the next sections, I will explain how I was drawn towards the 90s
aesthetics. In what ways do they support the goals that I outlined?

<h2>Approachable</h2>

<p>I write blog posts for people to read. I don’t want to distract the reader
with banners, ads, or even navigation. Forcing myself to use handwritten HTML
helps me feel less temptation to add unnecessary fluff.

<p>The reason that I draw cute pixel-art emoji is so that my friends and family
members can enjoy and use them.

<p>It's been argued that <a
href="http://www.dinofarmgames.com/a-pixel-artist-renounces-pixel-art/"
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pixel art is not approachable to the
modern audience</a>. In my experience, however, even the generations younger
than me have developed an appreciation for it. Minecraft and indie games have
kept the style alive, despite it no longer being necessary due to hardware
restrictions.

<h2>Effortless</h2>

<p>It's clear that some projects require more mental energy to progress than
others. I find it quite easy — relaxing even — to pull out my iPad and draw,
whereas making progress on a computer programming project requires few
distractions for long stretches of time.

<p>Even as an artist, I struggle with a blank canvas. Having too many options
causes me to freeze up. It takes mental energy to decide what to do next. A
common strategy to overcome this is to <a
href="https://medium.com/offline-camp/creating-with-constraints-broad-strokes-ftw-8cb00c9bee4c"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">boost creativity by using design
constraints</a>.

<p>Why make pixel art? It's a restriction, based on discrete mathematics and
the past. Restriction makes sharing my art a little less intimidating.
There's only so far you can take 16 by 16 pixels.

<p>Why make a blog post with static files? It's a restriction. I can spend
less time configuring and more time writing.

<h2>Future-proof</h2>

<p>In stepping back to a 90s aesthetic, I'm developing works that would have
been more-or-less usable on the software of 25 years ago. It's my hope that
this means my HTML, GIFs, and PNG images will be usable for at least another
25 years.

<h2>Modern technology</h2>

<p>Dat and IPFS are ideally suited to sharing static files. This means that
it's easy to share my site with modern peer-to-peer technologies.

<p>I'm hopeful that as these technologies develop and gain popularity, the
chance that my work disappears will go down. So long as someone finds what
I've made useful, it can stay alive on the distributed web.

Oregon 2019 had diverse backgrounds and interests, ranging far beyond  the
Offline First approach that we came together to discuss. Through  short passion
talks, campers shared with us some of the hobbies,  projects, and technologies
that excite them. We’re sharing a taste of  that passion with you here as a
preview to our
