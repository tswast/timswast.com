<em>I have posted a <a
href="/blog/2018/07/21/5-years-of-ssite/">retrospective of 5 years using
ssite</a> with more details on how I'm using it and why. Previously this page
announced a tool called Locoloco. That name was not respectful of those with
mental illness. I have changed the name to ssite, which also better reflects
its purpose.</em>

<p class="p-summary">Say hello to ssite, the little blog engine that doesn't
do much. This past weekend I built a blog engine to keep my site organized.
It differs from existing engines in that it does much less. It generates an
index without templating or modifying the articles at all.</p>

<p>You can check out the code on <a
href="https://github.com/tswast/ssite">GitHub.</a>

<h2>What's the point?</h2>
<p>For various reasons, I have decided to keep my blog as simple, static
HTML. There are many existing tools for this, such as the popular <a
href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, <a
href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll,</a> and <a
href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde.</a> In these solutions, one writes
articles in plain text, <a
href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, or a
template language of some sort. I would like to keep my blog articles as
plain HTML rather than generating them. Therefore, ssite generates an
index of the articles and nothing else.

<p>The reason for doing things this way is two-fold. First, it fits my
workflow better. I keep my blog synced to multiple computers on multiple
different platforms. It was a pain to keep the same versions of the
dependencies on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

<p>The most important reason I choose to keep the blog updated this way is
stability. I have observed that <a
href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/chaostsa/">sites from the 1990s</a>
which were written in plain HTML <a
href="https://users.math.yale.edu/public_html/People/frame/Fractals/">still
work well today</a>, even if it may look a little dated, but sites that
depend on dynamic generation (including some of my early projects) are now
defunct. By keeping things simple, I hope to make it more likely that links
to sites that I built will continue to work long after I'm gone.

<h2>Getting started.</h2>

<p><b>Update: <time class="dt-updated" datetime="2018-07-21">July 21,
2018</time></b>:
These instructions no longer work with the latest version of ssite. Check out
the <a href="https://github.com/tswast/ssite">GitHub repository</a> for the
most recent instructions.

<p>Using ssite is pretty easy.<br>
<code>blogindex.py $BLOGDIR</code><br>
It should "just work" if you use the same date-based directory scheme of
<code>YYYY/MM/DD/post-title/index.html</code> that I do.
