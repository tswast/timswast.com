        Say hello to Locoloco, the (crazy) little (blog) engine that didn't. This past weekend I built a blog engine to keep my site organized. It differs from existing engines in that it does much less. It generates an index without modifying the articles at all.

        <h2>Isn't this crazy and/or pointless?</h2>
        <p>
            For various reasons, I have decided to keep my blog as simple, static HTML. There are many existing tools for this, such as the popular <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll,</a> and <a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde.</a> In these solutions, one writes articles in plain text, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, or a template lang of some sort. I would like to keep my blog articles as plain html rather than generating them. Therefore, Locoloco generates an index of the articles and nothing else.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason for doing things this way is two-fold. First, it fits my workflow better. I keep my blog synced to multiple computers on multiple different platforms. It was a pain to keep the same versions of the dependencies on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most important reason I choose to keep the blog updated this way is stability. I have observed that plain HTML from the 1990s still works well today, even if it may look a little dated, but sites that depend on dynamic generation (including some of my early projects) are now defunct. By keeping things simple, I hope to make it more likely that links to sites that I built will continue to work long after I'm gone.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting started.</h2>
        <p>
            Using Locoloco is pretty easy.<br>
            <code>blogindex.py $BLOGDIR</code><br>
            It should "just work" if you use the same date-based directory scheme that I do.
        </p>
