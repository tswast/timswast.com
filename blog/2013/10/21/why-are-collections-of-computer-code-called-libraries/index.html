<p class="e-summary">My wife is an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivist">archivist</a>. As a library
professional, one of her peeves is when technology workers, such as myself,
use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">library to
mean a collection of computer code</a>. Because computer code libraries
generally are not managed by a librarian, the term seems misapplied.
</p>

<p> I was surprised to read in John G. Kemeny's <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684130092/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0684130092&linkCode=as2&tag=thnebetu-20">Man
and the Computer</a><img

width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;
margin:0px !important;" /> the term library applied to collections of
computer code. In 1972 computer code collections had not grown to <a
href="https://github.com/blog/1382-three-million-users">millions of
repositories</a> to which today's programmers have access, but amount
of code was growing.
</p>

<p> Since Kemeny is an inventor of BASIC, which has a <a
href="http://www.truebasic.com/node/1040">LIBRARY</a>
keyword, I probably should not have been surprised by this. Mostly,
it feels just a bit strange that the term library has been used for
collections of reusable code just about as long as collections of
reusable computer code have existed!
