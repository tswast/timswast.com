        <p class="p-summary">
            It occurred to me the other day, I don't really think of
            hexadecimal numerals as numbers. I think this is for the
            same reason I don't think of ID numbers or credit card numbers
            as numbers. When I read these, I say each digit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although both may be written 123, there is a clear difference
            between one, two, three and than one hundred, twenty-three.
            In the former I am thinking of an identifier. The digits are
            merely being used as symbols. In the latter, one hundred, twenty-three
            is an amount. I visualize some number of <em>things.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>What are hexadecimal numerals?</h2>
        <p>
            A hexadecimal numeral is
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">usually described</a>
            as a number's representation in
            <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#page-10">base 16</a>.
            That is, rather than writing a number with 10 possible digits,
            we use 16 possible digits. Usually these 16 digits are 0 through 9 and
            A through F.
        </p>

        <p>
            Programmers and web designers see these an awful lot, as hexadecimal numerals
            are a way of
            <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/04/the-code-side-of-color/">specifying colors</a>
            for the web.
        </p>

        <h2>How <em>should</em> we read hexadecimal numerals?</h2>
        <p>
            If a numeral represents a number, it should be read as a number.
            We cannot use the same names as we do for decimal numbers, though.
            For example, saying ten for 10<sub>16</sub> could be confusing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, I propose an unambiguous system for naming hexadecimal numbers.
            I'm not the
            <a href="http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-to-pronounce-hexadecimal-numbers.html">first</a>
            <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/107496">person</a>
            to
            <a href="http://www.intuitor.com/hex/words.html">suggest</a> this, but
            I would like the names to be as similar to the words we are used to.
            For example, Jon Purdy's suggestion that 20<sub>16</sub> be pronounced
            &ldquo;twentex&rdquo; is not ideal, because twenty has a hard and then a
            soft syllable, but twentex is two hard syllables.
        </p>

        <p>
            I propose the following pronunciations for hexadecimal digits:
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">0</td>
                <td>zero</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">1</td>
                <td>one</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">2</td>
                <td>two</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">3</td>
                <td>three</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">4</td>
                <td>four</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">5</td>
                <td>five</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">6</td>
                <td>six</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">7</td>
                <td>seven</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">8</td>
                <td>eight</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">9</td>
                <td>nine</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">A</td>
                <td>hey</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">B</td>
                <td>bee</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">C</td>
                <td>see</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">D</td>
                <td>dee</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">E</td>
                <td>ee</td>
                <td class="digit-cell">F</td>
                <td>eff</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            For two digits, we could use:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">10</td>
                <td>hexy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">20</td>
                <td>twexy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">30</td>
                <td>thrixy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">40</td>
                <td>fourxy (forks-ee)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">50</td>
                <td>fixy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">60</td>
                <td>sexy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">70</td>
                <td>senexy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">80</td>
                <td>eighxy (ache-see)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">90</td>
                <td>nixy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">A0</td>
                <td>haehexy (hey-hexy)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">B0</td>
                <td>baexy (bake-see)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">C0</td>
                <td>seehexy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">D0</td>
                <td>deexy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">E0</td>
                <td>eexy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="digit-cell">F0</td>
                <td>effexy (effects-see)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            I'm sure these suggestions aren't perfect, either, but hopefully they will be
            easier to use than some of the other suggestions. Words continually evolve,
            even as I can make them up these neologisms. For example,  my inital plan for
            AO (haehexy) as haexy wouldn't work with a southern accent. It would have been ambiguous
            with 10 (hexy).
