    I learned about the artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a> last month through the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/google-art-project-puts-an-art-masterpiece-on-every-new-1691052441">Google Art Project New Chrome Tab</a> extension. He is known as &ldquo;the painter of light&rdquo; and after looking at some of his works, I agree with that statement.

    Seeing the great use of light in J. M. W. Turner's Fishermen at Sea, I decided I'd try emulating it but in pixel art style. This was a lot more ambitious than my previous works, and it definitely stretched my skills. It took a month of drawing sessions (mostly in the morning on the couch at breakfast), but I finally finished it.

  <p>
    It really made me appreciate how J. W. M. Turner must have spent even more time and had even more skill to create such a beautiful, realistic scene using paint.
