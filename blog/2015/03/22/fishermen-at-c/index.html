<p class="e-summary">I learned about the artist <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>
last month through the <a
href="http://lifehacker.com/google-art-project-puts-an-art-masterpiece-on-every-new-1691052441">Google
Art Project New Chrome Tab</a> extension. He is known as &ldquo;the painter
of light&rdquo; and after looking at some of his works, I agree with that
statement.

<p>Seeing the great use of light in J. M. W. Turner's Fishermen at Sea, I
decided I'd try emulating it but in pixel art style. This was a lot more
ambitious than my previous works, and it definitely stretched my skills. It
took a month of drawing sessions (mostly in the morning on the couch at
breakfast), but I finally finished it. </p>

<p>It really made me appreciate how J. W. M. Turner must have spent even
more time and had even more skill to create such a beautiful, realistic
scene using paint.</p>
