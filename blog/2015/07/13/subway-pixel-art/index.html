  <p>
    I was riding an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(New_York_City_Subway_service)">E train</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R160_(New_York_City_Subway_car)">subway car</a> in New York City, and I noticed some pixel art in the wild. The nice FIND (Flexible Information and Notice Display) system which shows next stops includes a pixel art wheelchair icon for accessible stations.
  </p>

  <p>After admiring this, I decided to recreate it.</p>

  <img class="pixel-art" src="wheelchair-pixel-art.png" alt="a pixel-art version of a wheelchair symbol">

  <p>One reason I really enjoy pixel art is that it allows you to do a lot with very few materials. Here the MTA subway car uses only 16 red LED lights, but does so in a way that is obvious what they are trying to communicate.</p>
