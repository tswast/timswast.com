        I participated in the <a href="http://0hgame.eu/">zero hour game
            jam</a> this early morning time change. It was a lot of fun.  The
        zero hour game jam is a goofy idea that you can use the "extra" hour we
        get at 2 AM the night of the fall daylight savings switch to make a
        game. As you can imagine, it generates a lot of goofy little games.
        It's been super fun the years I've participated.

        I used it as an excuse to learn <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>.
        I think it has gotten easier since last time I tried, mostly because of
        the Signals package documentation, I think. I vaguely remember having
        to do tilde symbols before.
