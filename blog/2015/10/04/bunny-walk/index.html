tiny bunny is jumping his way to the right, hopefully to find a field of
juicy carrots.</p>

      I like using the smaller canvas because it is a challenge to find a
      shape that works, but also easier because there is no temptation to try
      to add more detail. Also, I'm learning that limiting the amount of
      motion can make for a better animation.

      When I have too much going on, it can be really hard to track what is
      happening. With only a few pixels changing, the mind can fill in that
      the legs must have moved rather than trying to figure out if a pixel is
      supposed to be part of the back or ears.
