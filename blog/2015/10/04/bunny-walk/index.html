      This is a different take on a walking animation. This tiny bunny is jumping his way to the right, hopefully to find a field of juicy carrots.

      I like using the smaller canvas because it is a challenge to find a shape that works, but also easier because there is no temptation to try to add more detail. Also, I'm learning that limiting the amount of motion can make for a better animation.

      When I have too much going on, it can be really hard to track what is happening. With only a few pixels changing, the mind can fill in that the legs must have moved rather than trying to figure out if a pixel is supposed to be part of the back or ears.
