        My brother, Jon Swast, is living in Japan and has posted some very
        beautiful pictures of the cherry blossoms there and in Korea. I found
        <a href="imgs/Sakura-JonSwast-photo.jpg">this one to be particularly
        beautiful</a> and decided to use it as a reference for practicing
        pixel art.

        I had been itching to draw some more pixel art, so I used this photo as
        a template. For this 64 pixels by 64 pixels image, I used colors from the
        photo itself for the color palette.
    </p>
    <img id="photo-palette-64"
        class="u-pixel-art u-photo" src="imgs/Sakura-PhotoPalette-64.png"
        alt="cherry tree 64 by 64 pixels with color palette from photo">

      I think it turned out well. This is actually the sixth picture that
      I drew using this photo. I also drew it at 32 pixels by 32 pixels with the
      same color palette.
    </p>
    <img id="photo-palette-32"
        class="u-pixel-art u-photo" src="imgs/Sakura-PhotoPalette-32.png"
        alt="pixel art tree 32 by 32 pixels with color palette from photo">

      And at 16 by 16 pixels.
    </p>
    <img id="photo-palette-16"
        class="u-pixel-art u-photo" src="imgs/Sakura-PhotoPalette-16.png"
        alt="cherry tree 16 by 16 pixels with color palette from photo">

    <p>
      For the other drawings, I drew them at the same three sizes, but used
      the color palette bundled with <a href="http://pixaki.com/">Pixaki</a>,
      which is the app I used to draw all of these images.

      Overall, this was a fun project. It was quite relaxing to draw these on
      the plane and just before bed time. The 16 by 16 pixel art trees are
      difficult to tell what they are, but it was nice to start there since
      it helped me choose the colors to use. The drawings appear in this article
      in the reverse order that I drew them.
