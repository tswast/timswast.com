<p class="e-summary">I've had quite a few train rides this past month. One thing I really love
about trains is that there isn't as much stop and go. This makes it much
easier to draw while I travel. Alexandra and I visited <a
href="http://roundhouse.ca/about-us/engine-374/">Engine 374 in the Yaletown
Roundhouse in Vancouver, B.C.</a>, and this inspired me to draw a train
during our train rides.</p>

<p>I'm fascinated by old steam trains. The I especially enjoyed looking at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive_U-127">Russian steam
locomotive U-127</a> while browsing for reference photos on Wikipedia. It is
the trainiest of all the trains that looked at. The engine is distinct, and
its exaggerated features made the U-127 perfect for a pixel art rendition.

<p>It was a lot of fun to draw. I also really enjoyed testing out the new animation
features in <a href="http://pixaki.com">Pixaki 3.0</a> on my iPad. It's really nice
to be able to draw and then animate all in my favorite pixel art app.
