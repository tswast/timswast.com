<div class="e-content">
<p class="e-summary">My interest in generative art and art bots brought my attention to works by
<a href="http://inconvergent.net">Anders Hoff</a>. I love that he explains how
he made many of his works, including
<a href="http://inconvergent.net/generative/linetrace/">linetrace</a>.
It was computer-generated, but inspired by the
<a href="http://www.johnfranzen.com/each-line-one-breath.html">hand-drawn
works by John Franzen</a>. I have found it quite relaxing to draw something
similar by hand during breaks at work. It's quite the stress-reducer.</p>

<p>It's funny how much my steadiness varies, even within a single day. I
think I get quite a bit more jittery when stressed. Maybe this is a good
way to keep track of my current state?

<p>Also, it feels weird to make something by hand that Anders Hoff did so
well with a computer, especially since I'm a programmer. I could definitely
be more "productive" (produce more, maybe even better, pictures) were I
to also write a program like he did, but I really like the idea of doing
things by hand. It isn't quite as relaxing to run or write a computer
program as it is to carefully trace a line.
