<h1 class="p-name">12 Virtual Date Ideas for 2020</h1>

<div class="e-content">
<p class="p-summary">This has been a unique year to start dating again. With
a global pandemic in full swing, it's important to stay home and socially
distance. Despite the challenges of the current situation, I've found a few
creative date ideas that have made virtual dating more fun.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Choose a video chat app that you both are comfortable using. <a
href="https://duo.google.com/">Google Duo</a> and <a
href="https://meet.google.com/">Google Meet</a> have been my go-tos, but I've
also used <a
href="https://support.apple.com/guide/facetime/welcome/mac">Apple
Facetime</a> and <a
href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060492-Voice-or-Video-Calling">Signal</a>.
For the best lighting and angle, I've found a <a
href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GDC39Y2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">ring
light with a phone holder</a> to be super useful. If you can't get a ring
light, make sure whatever light source you have is in front of you
rather than behind you.

<p>Some nights you might not be feeling up to a video call. Many of these
ideas work pretty well on a phone call, too.

<h2>Ask open-ended questions üïµÔ∏è</h2>
<h3>#1 - 400 first-date questions</h3>

<p>Ask each other random questions from this list of <a
href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/kendra-syrdal/2018/05/first-date-questions/">400+
first date questions</a>. Feel free to veto any question you're not
comfortable answering. I like being truly random and using a tool like
random.org to help pick from the list.

<h3>#2 - 36 questions</h3>

<p>Try out the
<a href="https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/36_questions_for_increasing_closeness">36 questions for increasing closeness</a>
exercise together. If you follow the suggested time limits, you won't make it
through all of 36 of them, but that means you'll have more to talk about the
next time.

<h3>#3 - Gottman card decks app</h3>

<p>Ask each other questions from the "open-ended" or "date-night" decks in
the <a href="https://www.gottman.com/couples/apps/">Gottman card decks
app</a> for <a href="http://bit.ly/2y5ntJW">Android</a> or <a
href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gottman-card-decks/id1292398843?mt=8">iPhone</a>.
Some of these aren't relevant if you're starting to get to know each other,
but a lot are.

<h2>Eat and drink üßë‚Äçüç≥</h2>
<h3>#4 - Ice cream date</h3>

<p>Buy your favorite ice cream at the grocery. Scoop yourself a bowl of it
and video chat with each other. Get the conversation started by talking about
which ice cream you're eating and why you like it.

<h3>#5 - Cook dinner together</h3>

<p>Put your phone or computer on your fridge or counter. Pour yourself a
drink and chat while you each make dinner.

<h3>#6 - Virtual pub crawl</h3>

<p>Buy some cocktail ingredients and watch a <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/timetravelpubcrawls/">time travel pub
crawl</a> on one device while you video chat on another device. Have fun
making drinks and talking about the skits and historical photos with each
other.

<h2>Play üé≤</h2>
<h3>#7 - Play a board game</h3>

<p>Play some 2-player games together on
<a href="https://boardgamearena.com/">Board Game Arena</a>. You don't need
the pro version to play most games, but I think it's worth it for the full
catalog. Some of my favorites for 2 players are
<a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=kingdomino">Kingdomino</a>,
<a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=takenoko">Takenoko</a>
(cute pandas!), and
<a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=sushigo">Sushi Go!</a>
(cute sushi!).

<p>Board games are also great for a double-date. Some of my closest friends
don't live in the same city as me, so this is a perfect way for everyone meet
each other.

<h3>#8 - Play a video game</h3>

<p>Lots of video games can be played cooperatively online now. One of my
favorites for date night is <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/">Stardew
Valley</a>. It's a relaxed game, so it leaves lots of time to chat. I
especially like going to the beach and fishing together.

<p>Video games can also work really well for double or triple dates. I quite
enjoy <a
href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/drawful-two/?gclid=CjwKCAjw0_T4BRBlEiwAwoEiAbzHiWQ3_Yn1FWF2pZ5conRcbueb1tiTWniy1zujAUHVQVmtOf-kWxoCQ8kQAvD_BwE">Drawful
2</a> and the <a
href="https://shop.jackboxgames.com/collections/steam-codes/products/the-jackbox-party-pack-3-pc-mac-linux-code">Jackbox
party pack games</a> for this, as they are really social. With Google Meet,
use the option to present your whole screen with the game and everyone else
can follow along.

<h2>Watch üìΩÔ∏è</h2>

<h3>#9 - Virtually go to the movies</h3>

<p>Watch a movie together. To keep the video in sync, you can use the
<a href="https://www.netflixparty.com/">Netflix Party browser extension</a>
or give yourselves a 3-2-1 countdown and press play at the same time.

<h3>#10 - Watch the same livestream concert</h3>

<p>Watch a livestream concert of one of your favorite musicians. I've been
watching <a href="https://danmanganmusic.com/">Dan Mangan</a> on <a
href="https://sidedooraccess.com/home">Side Door</a> with a friend for just
about every one of his shows so far.

<h3>#11 - DIY a mini film festival</h3>

<p>Each of you pick out 5 short videos to share and take turns
presenting them to each other. Sharing funny clips is a great way to get
to know each others' sense of humor.

<h2>Travel ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>

<h3>#12 - Virtual walking tour</h3>

<p>Pick out a few of your favorite places and "walk" around together in
Google Street View. This is even better in VR with <a
href="https://mashable.com/article/wander-vr-oculus-quest-2-travel/">Wander</a>,
but it works well over video chat, too. This date offers great opportunities
to tell each other interesting stories.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Meeting in person adds a whole new dimension (literally) to dates, but
it's still possible to have fun and get to know someone over video. There are
a lot of benefits to virtual dates. You'll save time and money, and you'll
have opportunities to go on fun dates that you otherwise might not do in
person. I love that I get to go on cooking dates without the pressure
associated with being in someone else's apartment.

<p>Hopefully this helps you feel a little more comfortable to virtually get
out there and meet people. Stay safe!
