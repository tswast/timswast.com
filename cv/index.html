  <h2>Work Experience</h2>

  <h3>Google (Seattle, WA) [August 2015 to present]</h3>
  <p>Software Friendliness Engineer (a.k.a <a
  href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/developer-programs-engineer-say-what-b12829729693">Developer
  Programs Engineer</a>) for Google Cloud Platform.
  </p>

  <h3>Google (Austin, TX) [August 2013 to August 2015]</h3>
  <p>
    Software Engineer for the Google for Work (Enterprise) team. I have
    worked on three projects so far, working primarily in Java, Python, and
    JavaScript, with some Go and Dart.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      [August 2013 to June 2014] User access. I developed software
      infrastructure to provide access to Google for Work tools (for example
      to a tool to file support tickets) to users who do not yet have a
      Google account. This touched many layers of the software stack,
      including Pub Sub, database access, and RPC. I worked closely with my
      engineering peers in Mountain View and Austin on this project.
    </li>
    <li>
      [June 2014 to August 2015] Partner Sales Tool - Ordering. I designed
      and implemented a tool which consolidated seven different order forms,
      covering all Google for Work products, into a central system (Java
      &amp; JavaScript, running on Google App Engine). I was responible for
      managing this project for a distributed team of 5-7 engineers, spread
      across India and the United States. I discovered and proposed solutions
      to business requirements across many product teams. Some of these
      requirements differed across products. In these cases, I suggested a
      single process to consolidate across product teams, and many times they
      agreed. Work continues on this project as new products are launched and
      business processes are streamlined.
    </li>
    <li>
      [December 2013 to present, 20% project] I have been working directly
      with a business analytics team at Google, building a software framework
      (written primarily in Python) to help with creating and analysis of
      experiments.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    Oracle (Austin, TX) [August 2011 to August 2013]<br>
    Software Engineer, focusing on SPARC performance
  </h3>

  <p>
    As an Associate Software Engineer in Oracle Strategic Applications Engineering I measured and published standard benchmark results, run on Oracle hardware. In the months before the SPARC T5-8 release, I ran and published the TPC-C benchmark as part of a small team. It was similar to a DevOps role where I set up and ran the distributed system: application software, operating system, hardware, and network.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a DevOps-type role, I wrote the tools needed to set up and monitor the system. Since we were working on new hardware and new operating systems, we had to roll our own installation scripts as well as occasionally using cluster SSH to run commands on hundreds of machines at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    The monitoring data we collected included everything from DTrace profiles of kernel functions to "iostat" data about disk activity. I wrote software to parse, analyze, and visualize this data, both in realtime (to identify problems in a running benchmark) and in batch (to help identify bottlenecks). I used a variety of open source tools to construct a data toolkit for other teams running benchmarks at Oracle, including RRDtool, D3.js, and the Python libraries Graphite and Matplotlib for visualization, and the libraries Numpy and SciPy for batch analysis (clustering, outlier detection).
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to installation and monitoring software, I wrote microbenchmarks to simulate various parts of the workload. One such microbenchmark issued asynchronous I/O of the appropriate size to simulate REDO log writes. These microbenchmarks helped the team to evaluate different hardware and software stacks as part of capacity planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to running as close to "metal" as possible, I also evaluated many different virtualization techniques and evaluated how they relate to performance. I have helped my coworkers administer, collect, analyze, and compare data collected from systems using Zones, LDOMs/OVM-for-SPARC, VirtualBox, and VMware.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Applied Tribology (Byron, WI) [part-time, June 2005-August 2013]<br>
    Software Engineer, Machine Reliability
  </h3>
  <p>
    Applied Tribology is a consulting company run by Joseph Tevaarwerk which helps with reliability analysis as well as fluid dynamics. I was the primary software developer working on statistical software, working directly with Joseph on the projects he needed. This included anything from updating Fortran and TrueBasic code to run behind a new graphical interface, to rewriting utilities in Python for desktop computers, creating visulizations of failure data, and creating custom iPad apps in Objective C.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Logos Bible Software (Bellingham, WA) [Summer 2008 &amp; 2009]<br>
    Software Engineer
  </h3>
  <p>
    As a Software Development Intern, I helped develop the C#/WPF application, Logos Bible Software 4. I specialized in creating the data visualization widgets. These tools show heat maps and charts of words, phrases, topics, and grammatical structure across many different biblical texts. I also optimized and restructured code, providing at 10x speed-up in tree visualization animations.
  </p>
  <img src="images/logos-passage-analysis-morphriver.png" alt="A river-like chart of grammar used in biblical text" />
  <p>
    The widgets I created were used in a product with many hundreds of thousands of lines of C# and C++ code, built by a team of 12 full-time developers, 12 interns, and a handful of designers. To make all of our lives better, I implemented unit tests to ensure the the widgets I built could be easily used in any part of the project.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Mercury Marine (Fond du Lac, WI) [July 2006 to August 2007]<br>
    Software Engineer
  </h3>
  <p>
    As a Software Development Co-op I wrote web software to support the Design and Engineering department. This included anything from inventory tracking to R&amp;D tools.
  </p>

  <h2>Skills</h2>

  <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
  <p>
    I know these languages very well, and am very comfortable in these languages because I use them almost daily for the past few years.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Python</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I have used these languages professionally. I am still somewhat comfortable in these, but I am not an expert in them.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Dart</li>
    <li>Go</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>Matlab - used for course work</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I have used these languages professionally. I no longer use them often or at all, but I'm confident that I could relearn them very quickly.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ActionScript</li>
    <li>ColdFusion</li>
    <li>Fortran</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>TrueBasic</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
  <h4>Automated testing</h4>
  <p>
    I wrote unit tests for Logos Bible Software and Applied Tribology, but since joining Google, I have learned a lot about writing testable software, unit tests, and integration tests. I am an advocate on my team for writing tests. I lead by example by including tests in every change I make and distribute "Testing on the Toilet" fliers every week to ensure that my team is up to date on the latest techniques.
  </p>

  <h4>Agile</h4>
  <p>
    I participate in sprint planning and task allocation. By working in an Agile way, this has helped provide more accurate estimates and keep the bug list under better control.
  </p>

  <h4>Version Control</h4>
  <p>
    I'm comfortable in many different forms of version control, using the following frequently:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>perforce</li>
    <li>git</li>
    <li>mercurial</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Other forms of version control I have used professionally, but haven't used much lately:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>bazaar</li>
    <li>visual sourcesafe</li>
    <li>sccs</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Other technologies</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Dependency injection (Guice, Dagger) - I use this all the time. It helps make testing easier by keeping each class more narrowly defined.</li>
    <li>App Engine</li>
    <li>Cloud Pub Sub</li>
    <li>Cloud SQL (MySQL compatible)</li>
    <li>SciPy, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, IPython - When I do data analysis in Python these make the job much easier.</li>
  </ul>
